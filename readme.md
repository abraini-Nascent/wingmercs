# Asteroids 3D  

Hi  
This is a simple tech demonstrator that I used to look at new features of BabylonJS, BabylonGUI, miniplex, PeerJS, havok physics, a custom camera, and arcade flight sim physics. 
  
Its gone as far as the little asteroids demo will go, from here I'll expand it into something else but from here there will be a pretty big diversion and I don't have the time to continue out a full fledged asteroids  clone =D
