/**
 * The AI has three layers
 * The Top is MISSION which determins what the large scale goal of the AI and AI coordination should be
 * - examples of missions are: Patrol, Escort, Bomb Run
 * The Middle is OBJECTIVE which determins how the AI should be achieving the mission goal in the moment
 * - examples of objectives are: navigate to point, follow leader, engage enemy, flee enemy, return to base
 * The final layer is EXECUTION which determins how to execute the objective. 
 * - for example when the ai is engaged, is it strafing, dodging, or closing distance?
 * 
 * We should be able to compose a graph of these layers with reusable nodes. 
 * closing the distance to a patrol node and closing on an enemy are effectively the same
